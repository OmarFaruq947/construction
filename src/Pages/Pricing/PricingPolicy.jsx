          <li>
            Notice Period: Describe the notice period that the terminating party
            must provide to the other party. This period allows the
            non-terminating party time to rectify issues or make arrangements
            for project termination

          <li>

            calculating the value of the work completed and any approved change
            orders.
          </li>
          <li>
            Termination Costs: Detail any costs associated with contract

            deadlines.

          <li>
            Subcontractor and Supplier Payments: Address how the termination
            will affect payments to subcontractors and suppliers. It's important

          <li>
            Ownership of Work: Define who will have ownership of any work,
            drawings, plans, and specifications created for the project. This

            another contractor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dispute Resolution: Include a provision for resolving disputes
            related to the termination, such as through mediation, arbitration,
            or litigation.

          <li>
            Compliance with Legal Requirements: Ensure that the cancellation
            policy complies with local laws and regulations regarding
